#secreter-santa
This is a python script to generate secret santa matchings such that it is less likely for someone to be assigned a person if he or she has already had that person in years previous. This works by creating a weighted bipartite graph of Santas and running the Munkres algorithm over them.
In the construction of the graph, people are given a maximum cost of 100 to themselves and the person they had the year previous, and then a cost for every other person based on how many times each person has been had previously. There's also a small amount of random cost assigned to every person that isn't already at the maximum cost, because secret santa should always have some level of randomness involved.
